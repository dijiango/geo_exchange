# GeoExchange

This project was built with vanilla Javascript with currency exchange rates data from the [VAT comply API](https://vatcomply.com/) and Earth still images adapted from NASA's Visible Earth Catalog of [The Blue Marble](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/57723/the-blue-marble).


## Set Up

A CLI is not necessary to view this project in browser. Clone the directory and run the `index.html` file in your computer.

## Usage

GeoExchange was created for the traveler who always plans ahead. Fetching live exchange rates data from the European Central Bank, users can use the <strong>Currency Calculator</strong> to budget their next adventure. Use the <strong>navigation buttons</strong> to rotate the globe and compare your home currency to the top 10 most commonly traded currencies in the world.
